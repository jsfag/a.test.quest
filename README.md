Test work

Description: implement a small CRUD single page application for managing a list of cities.

1. When the application starts a list of countries and their capitals (up to 10 items) should be loaded via AJAX from locations.json file and placed to a table with columns City and Country.
2. There should be the ability to filter cities by entering text in the filter text input. Filtering should be case insensitive.
3. Items in the list should be sortable either by their default order, city name or by country using Sort By dropdown.
4. There should be the ability to add cities into the list. Clicking on the Add button should open a dialog with two input fields - City and Country, and two buttons - Ok and Cancel.
5. When one or more item is selected, the Remove button should become enabled. Clicking on it should remove selected items from the list.
6. Items in the list must be hoverable and selectable using different colors.
7. You can use Vanilla JS.

Please place this test work to a public repository and send me a link (for example github or bitbucket).
