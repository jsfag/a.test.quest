Test work

Description: implement a small CRUD single page application for managing a list of cities.

* When the application starts a list of countries and their capitals (up to 10 items) should be loaded via AJAX from locations.json file and placed to a table with columns City and Country.
* There should be the ability to filter cities by entering text in the filter text input. Filtering should be case insensitive.
* Items in the list should be sortable either by their default order, city name or by country using Sort By dropdown.
* There should be the ability to add cities into the list. Clicking on the Add button should open a dialog with two input fields - City and Country, and two buttons - Ok and Cancel.  
* ~~When one or more item is selected, the Remove button should become enabled. Clicking on it should remove selected items from the list.~~
* Items in the list must be hoverable and selectable using different colors.
* You can use Vanilla JS.

Please place this test work to a public repository and send me a link (for example github or bitbucket).
